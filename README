INTRO
=====

Marave is a text editor whose goal is to help you focus on writing.

It's inspired by ommwriter, Darkroom and many other "simple" text 
editors, with a few twists.

REQUIREMENTS
============

As far as I know, all that's needed is:

* PyQt 4.5 or later.
  On Ubuntu and other linuxes, this may mean python-qt4-phonon or some other
  packages in addition to PyQt.

* PyEnchant if you want spellchecking, plus the spellchecking dictionaries for your language.

* I intend to make binaries available for Windows, and am looking for volunteers help to have
  Mac binaries as well.

MENU
====

If you move your button, you will see a button bar at the right side of the screen.

They are:

* Your font selector

  You can set the font and color of your text.

* Your font size selector

  You can make it larger, smaller, or go back to default.

* The usual file operations

  Open, Save and Save As. For "New File", use Ctrl+N

* A background selector

  Cycle the available backgrounds using the arrows, or use a solid colour.

* A keyclick selector

  Cycle the available key sounds, or disable key clicks.

* A "music station" selector

  Cycle available music stations, or disbale music.

* Extra preferences

  Several options, including editor opacity, spellchecking language and more.

* Quit

CHEATCODES
==========

Since the UI is minimal, there are some key combinatios that do things you will not
find any buttons for.

* Undo: Ctrl+Z 
* Redo: Strift+Ctrl+Z 
* New Document: Ctrl+N
* Open: Ctrl+O
* Save: Ctrl+S
* Save As: Shift+Ctrl+S
* Find: Ctrl+F
* Find & Replace: Ctrl+R
* Quit: Ctrl+Q
* Document information: Ctrl+I

Adjusting the editor
====================

The Marave window is *always* full screen, you can't change that, but you can change th size of your editor.

If you move your mouse, you will see 4 faint boxes in the corners. Dragging them makes the editor larger or smaller.

If you place the mouse just outside the editor, it should change its shape to a hand. Clicking and dragging will let you move the editor. Remember that the buttons are on the right side, so 
you need some space there.

CUSTOMIZATION
=============

If you don't like the artwork that comes with Marave, you are of course free to replace it, or expand it.

* You can add new key click sounds by dropping audio files in the clicks folder
* You can add new backgrounds by dropping image files in the backgrounds folder
* You can add new radio stations by adding them in the radios.txt file (one
  per line)

INSTALLATION
============

To install from sources try this:

python setup.py install

To use Marave without installing, run

python main.py

in the marave folder.
