INTRO
=====

Marave is a text editor whose goal is to help you focus on writing.

It's inspired by ommwriter, Darkroom and many other "simple" text 
editors.

REQUIREMENTS
============

As far as I know, all that's needed is:

* PyQt 4.5 or later.
  On Ubuntu and other linuxes, this may mean python-qt4-phonon or some other
  packages in addition to PyQt.
* PyEnchant if you want spellchecking

CONFIGURATION
=============

Not there yet, but...

* You can add new key click sounds by dropping audio files in the clicks folder
* You can add new backgrounds by dropping image files in the backgrounds folder
* You can add new radio stations by adding them in the radios.txt file (one
  per line)
