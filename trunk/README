INTRO
=====

Marave is a text editor whose goal is to help you focus on writing.

It's inspired by ommwriter, Darkroom and many other "simple" text 
editors.

REQUIREMENTS
============

As far as I know, all that's needed is:

* PyQt 4.5 or later.
  On Ubuntu and other linuxes, this may mean python-qt4-phonon or some other
  packages in addition to PyQt.
* PyEnchant if you want spellchecking

CONFIGURATION
=============

Not there yet, but...

* You can add new key click sounds by dropping audio files in the clicks folder
* You can add new backgrounds by dropping image files in the backgrounds folder
* You can add new radio stations by adding them in the radios.txt file (one
  per line)

CHEATCODES

Since the UI is minimal, there are some key combinatios that do things you will not
find any buttons for.

* Undo: Ctrl+Z 
* Redo: Strift+Ctrl+Z 
* New Document: Ctrl+N
* Open: Ctrl+O
